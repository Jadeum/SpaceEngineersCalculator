# SpaceEngineersCalculator
This is for a Space Engineers torch server that I'm part of in order to do gold trading calculations. In it's current state, you enter in how many KG of gold ingot that you have, and it reads from 3 different CSV files that include item name and credit value. These are converted into a whole number of component objects, and produces the equivelant value of objects based off of two item sheets in the server. The PNG's of the price guides are included in this repository.
